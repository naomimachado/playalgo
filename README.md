# Playalgo
The game is built on the idea of play and learn algorithms. It is a 2-player racing game. It could
be classified as a serious learning game where each player is required to apply algorithmic logic
to progress in any stage of the game. In this release we have developed Guess Your Opponent
game.

Playing Guess Your Opponent is interesting as well as impactful. It intuitively improves your
application knowledge of searching algorithms.

A user can join a game channel “guess your opponent” as a player or viewer. A player can join
an existing game (where another user is waiting for opponent) or create a new challenge by
giving a challenge number (which will be guessed by the opponent) and a game name. When a
new game is created by the player, he will have to wait for the other player to join. Once both
players have joined, the game will begin.

# Limitations
 - Not a very sleak and intuitive UI.
 - Sometimes you should refresh if you are unable to join a game or don't see the existing games.
